This problem hinders the adoption of neural end-to-end approaches, which represent the state of the art in the two parent tasks of SLT: automatic speech recognition and machine translation. To fill this gap, we created MuST-C, a multilingual speech translation corpus whose size and quality will facilitate the training of end-to-end systems for SLT from English into 8 languages. For each target language, MuST-C comprises at least 385 hours of audio recordings from English TED Talks, which are automatically aligned at the sentence level with their manual transcriptions and translations. Together with a description of the corpus creation methodology (scalable to add new data and cover new languages), we provide an empirical verification of its quality and SLT results computed with a state-of-the-art approach on each language direction.},\n\tbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 2019 {Conference} of the {North} {American} {Chapter} of the {Association} for {Computational} {Linguistics}: {Human} {Language} {Technologies}, {Volume} 1 ({Long} and {Short} {Papers})},\n\tpublisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n\tauthor = {Di Gangi, Mattia A. and Cattoni, Roldano and Bentivogli, Luisa and Negri, Matteo and Turchi, Marco},\n}\n", "homepage": "", "license": "", "features": {"duration": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "offset": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "speaker_id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "doc_id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "audio": {"sampling_rate": 16000, "mono": true, "decode": true, "id": null, "_type": "Audio"}, "transcript": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "translation": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "task_templates": null, "builder_name": "mustc", "config_name": "es", "version": {"version_str": "2.3.3", "description": "", "major": 2, "minor": 3, "patch": 3}, "splits": {"validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 295180099, "num_examples": 1316, "dataset_name": "mustc"}}, "download_checksums": {}, "download_size": 0, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 295180099, "size_in_bytes": 295180099}}
