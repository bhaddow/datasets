### Dataset Summary

MuST-C is a multilingual speech translation corpus whose size and quality facilitates the training of end-to-end systems for speech translation from English into several languages. For each target language, MuST-C comprises several hundred hours of audio recordings from English TED Talks, which are automatically aligned at the sentence level with their manual transcriptions and translations.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

### Languages

English audio, translated into Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portugese,  Romanian, Russian and Spanish.
